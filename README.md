# paytondev
currently building useful ai-driven tools @ ai owl.  
previously @ nox. i make software that feels calm to use.

### work
- **spatialdock (visionos)** — minimal utility dock for vision pro. swiftui, tiny, opinionated.  
- **unoweb_flutter** — a rewrite of uno that actually scales. flutter, firebase, real-time multiplayer.  
- **chaos run** — an infinite runner where every obstacle is an event you can script.
- *lots more in private repos!*

### toolkit
swift • dart/flutter • typescript/react • node/tauri • python • go • linux internals when unavoidable

### values
build small. think clearly. respect the user’s time.
